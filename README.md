# NoSeedSpots_For-Stardew-Valley
A simple mod for Stardew Valley that allows the player to control the frequency of seed spots appearing on the map.


NO SEED SPOTS - 1.0
Have you no interest in the new seed spot mechanic introduced in 1.6? Do you like finding seasonal seeds, but maybe not that many? Look no further! I have just the thing for you.

Note: This mod has just been released, please consider checking under "Possible issues" on the mod page for things I need help testing out!

:: REQUIREMENTS ::
 - SMAPI 
 - (Optional but recommended) Generic Mod Config Menu

:: INSTALLATION ::
 1. Install the latest version of SMAPI.
 2. Unzip the mod folder into Stardew Valley/Mods.
 3. (Optional) Install the latest version of the Generic Mod Config Menuï»¿.
 4. Run the game using SMAPI.

:: FEATURES ::
 - Replaces generated seed spots with artifact spots in any map according to an user-defined spawn chance (default 0 for no seed spots ever).
- Persistent data: Reloading a map will NOT reroll the existing seed spots. You can tweak the spawn chances throughout the day and between days, and only new spawns will be affected - If you've visited that map before, of course.


::  KNOWN ISSUES ::
 - While data is persistent throughout the day and between day saves, closing the game without saving and loading it again means rerolling the seed spot spawn chances. This is because, while the vanilla game generates map objects for the next day when you save the game, my mod checks for those objects on save load. I might consider changing this someday, but I don't see a scenario where you would reload your game to get different spawns vs just tweaking the spawn chances so idk
